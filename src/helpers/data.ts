    title: 'Berlin Street Art',
    post: "\nBerlin has a long history as a vibrant hub for freedom of expression, from landmark art museums showcasing the German contribution to modern art to the era-defining street art etched by anti-government protestors in the 1960s.\n\nBerlin is still a city that attracts artists from all over the world. No matter where you walk in Berlin, you'll see the impact of art everywhere in this once-divided, now boldly progressive city.\n\nBerlin's street art tells the story of the city in vivid color, from playful murals designed to spark imagination to powerful political pieces tackling pressing social issues. Here’s our guide to the top places to admire Berlin’s street art.\n\n## East Side Gallery\nThe East Side Gallery is not only one of the best places to see street art in Berlin, it's also one of the most iconic landmarks in the city. The \"canvas\" for this 1.3km (one mile) open-air art gallery on the east bank of the Spree River is the longest-surviving section of the Berlin Wall.\n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall in the winter of 1989, 118 artists from 21 different countries traveled to East Berlin to paint colorful murals depicting the wave of political change sweeping across the world.\n\nUnfortunately, many of the original works have been lost over time, but replicas have been put up in their place. Preservation efforts are in place to protect the handful of original pieces that have survived the three decades since reunification. \n\nFrom the rounded, colorful cartoon heads daubed by artist, Thierry Noir, to political pieces celebrating the reunification of Germany, these works of art capture the spirit of what it means to be a Berliner.\n\n## RAW Compound\nRight in the heart of Berlin’s busiest nightlife area and not far from the East Side Gallery, the RAW Compound has it all. Set in the derelict buildings of a former train repair depot, RAW is the perfect stop for a quick bite to eat in the middle of the day and is home to some of Berlin’s hippest clubs once the sun goes down. It's also the setting for a busy flea market at weekends.\n\nWhat many visitors miss amongst the plethora of activities is the fascinating collection of street art on display in this former industrial wasteland. From easy-to-miss miniature sculptures hidden on corners to majestic murals decorating the entrances to dance clubs, the RAW compound is a lively hub for all sorts of counterculture creativity. \n\nThis is the kind of place to simply wander around with your camera, searching for artworks on the facades of each building; bring a wide-angle lens to capture larger works.",

    title: 'Norway’s natural attractions',
    post: 'Norway is a top destination for nature lovers. The country is renowned for its natural beauty and unique natural phenomena. We’ve put together the quick list of must-see natural attractions when planning your trip to Norway.\n\n# Northern Lights\nThis must-see phenomenon is on many a bucket list, and with good reason. It is magical. The experience of seeing the northern lights unbelievable colors dance across the night sky, is one like no other. Few places on earth offer the chance of seeing this natural attraction, but Norway is one of them. Between the end of September through March, the sun sets in the early afternoon in Northern Norway. With stunning mountains, fjords, and islands, it makes for one of the most beautiful backdrops when viewing the northern lights. In addition to stunning nature, Northern Norway also has fishing villages, cities, and museums. So after searching for the northern lights you can explore the cultural offerings that can be found in the region. Of course, Norwegians love their winter sports and there are plenty of outdoor activities you can participate in too, including: hiking, skiing, fishing, and dog sledding.\n\n# Midnight Sun\nOn the other end of the spectrum is the midnight sun. The midnight sun is a phenomenon whereby the sun doesn’t set for a period of time during the summer months in areas north of the Arctic Circle, including Northern Norway. It’s a special time of year with endless hours to explore the outdoors under the soft midnight light. As you move south in Norway, you won’t technically have the midnight sun, as the sun does set for a few short hours, but you will still be rewarded with what feels like endless hours of light with which to explore the glorious landscapes of Norway. This is one of our favorite natural attractions as it feels like life slows down and you’ve got time to go on that extra hike or sit with loved ones under the pink and golden sky and chat for hours.\n\n# Fjords\nNorway and fjords are synonymous so it’s no wonder that they’re included on our list of must-see natural attractions in Norway. Western Norway has some of the longest, deepest, and most beautiful fjords in the world. Two of these spectacular beauties are on UNESCO’s World Heritage List: Nærøyfjord, and Geirangerfjord. The Nærøyfjord is an arm of the Sognefjord and the narrowest fjord in the world, at one point measuring only 250m wide with mountains towering above its blue waters. Further north, not far from Norway Excursions home base of Ålesund, is the Geirangerfjord. The Geirangerfjord is known for its magnificent waterfalls, sapphire-blue water, and pristine beauty. The mountain sides are also dotted with many mountain farms overlooking the fjords that you’re able to hike to and visit. Fortunately, UNESCO has also listed and protected the unspoiled areas surrounding these two natural phenomena. These must-see natural attractions are best viewed by ferry or boat.\n\n# Mountains\nNorwegians have gone to the mountains for centuries as a remedy for all that ails them. In fact, many doctors will prescribe “frisk luft” or fresh air to their patients. From all over Norway, Norwegians migrate to the mountains, whenever given the chance, to breathe in the fresh air and take in the natural beauty of their home country. Much of Norway is, in fact, made up of mountains. While many countries have mountain ranges, it is the way that Norway’s erupt dramatically from sea-level that gives them their place on our must-see list of natural attractions. And truth be told, they’re hard to miss! We recommend hiking one of the thousands of easily accessible trails (of varying degrees of difficulty) and spending the night in one of many staffed lodges, self-service cabins, or no-service cabins, and enjoying the hytte experience in one of these tourist huts. The Norwegian right to roam ensures that everyone in the country has free access to the countryside. Be sure to pack layers of clothing as Norway’s weather is ever-changing.\n\n# Waterfalls\nThe waterfalls in Norway can be absolutely spectacular. In fact, 10 of the world’s 30 tallest waterfalls are found here. A central part of the Norwegian landscape, these powerhouses of nature are best experienced between May and June when the snow melt causes them to flow in their full splendor. The tallest free-falling single-drop waterfall in Norway is Vettisfossen, with a single drop of 275m. The tallest waterfalls in Norway drop over 800m, with Vinnufallet recorded as the tallest according to the World Waterfall Database. You don’t have to travel far, when in Norway, to see the waterfalls as they seem to be around every turn. The famous Seven Sisters waterfalls are a sight to behold when traveling through Geirangerfjord, but even a simple drive through the magnificent Romsdalen valley (near Åndalsnes), when timed right, provides jaw dropping waterfall after waterfall.',

    title: 'JavaScript best practices',
    post: 'Following JavaScript best practices can help achieve faster page loads and better performance, improve code readability, and make maintenance and debugging easier. \n\n# 1. Choose a JavaScript coding style guide and stick to it\nEven though you can set up your own coding guidelines that fit with your goals, you don’t necessarily have to. There are multiple ready-to-use JavaScript coding style guides that are well tested and widely used across the industry. Some examples include the community-based Idiomatic JavaScript, the Google JavaScript Style Guide, and AirBnB’s JavaScript Style Guide.\n\nUsing a coding style guide is especially important in teamwork, where multiple developers are working on the same project. As Idiomatic JavaScript puts it, “all code in any code base should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many people contributed.” Whether you create your own style guide or use a third-party one, consistent code will be easier to read, write, debug, and maintain.\n\n#2. Give descriptive names to variables and functions\nMake the names of your variables, functions, and other code structures easy to understand for anyone who works with your code. Don’t use names that are either too short or too long, and take care that they succinctly describe their own purpose.\n\nSome good examples are (from the DOM API): - Properties (variables): firstChild, isConnected, nextSibling - Methods (functions): getResponseHeader(), addEventListener() - Objects: XMLHttpRequest, NodeList - Interfaces: HTMLCollection, EventTarget\n\nAlso keep in mind that JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. As camel case capitalization is the most common naming system in JavaScript programming, you should use lower camelcase for variables and functions and upper camelcase for classes and interfaces for better code readability.\n\n# 3. Comment your code, but keep it short\nCommenting is a hot topic in programming. Some say it’s not necessary at all, but code without any comments gets hard to read after a while — especially when working on team or legacy projects. On the other hand, overly long and verbose comments are unnecessary because they’ll take extra time to read through and understand.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, comment your code, especially functions, classes, objects, and interfaces, but only include key information. To keep your comments concise and easy to read, use tags such as @constructor, @param, @version, @return, and others.\n\n# 4. Avoid using JavaScript to add styling\nTaking separation of concerns (SoC) seriously is one of the most important JavaScript coding practices. Technically, JavaScript allows you to directly change the CSS code using the style property. However, to make debugging easier and improve code maintainability, it’s best to avoid it.\n\nAs an alternative, you can add and remove classes using the ClassList API as follows (then add the style rules with CSS):\n\nNext steps\nThe JavaScript coding practices discussed above can help you write cleaner and better-structured code that’s easier to maintain and debug. However, creating development code is just the first step of the software life cycle.',

    title: 'Decorate like a real Scandinavian',
    post: "To save you the long search, we’ve prepared a list of 10 hacks to help you embrace the minimalism, ditch the extra furniture and become a master of Scandinavian interior design. Let’s jump in…\n\n# 1. It's all about the neutrals\nWe all know that Scandinavian winters are long and dark. That’s why you’ll see a lot of white and neutral colours that catch the natural light and make the rooms look bright and homely. If you want to follow the Scandinavian interior aesthetic, use a neutral colour palette with different shades of white, cream, tan, brown, grey, or even black.\n\n# 2. Stay away from the carpets\nKeep the floor coverage to a minimum. Exposed floors are a big thing in Scandinavian interiors, you’ll often be able to see the wooden planks that spread around all rooms. If you are after that real winter fairytale feel you can paint the floors white and add a cosy rug next to the bed and the sofa for a soft touch. Vintage fabric pieces are also popular with the Scandinavians, making you feel like you’re in a cottage somewhere in rural Norway. Check out some examples of brilliant floor decoration minus the wall-to-wall carpets.\n\n# 3. Don't hide the windows\nBig windows are central to this decor style but what’s specific to the Scandinavian design is that they’re often left uncovered. To let the maximum amount of light in and absorb it through the walls and floors, there are usually no blinds or curtains. If a curtain is a must, definitely opt for a soft, transparent one that doesn’t stop the light from coming in but still provides a little privacy.\n\n# 4. Make natural light your best friend\nNow this one is a bit obvious after mentioning the windows, but it’s so important that we had to mention it twice... natural light is vital in Scandinavian interior. Those long winters mean they need to make the most of the daylight they get. With walls that are commonly painted in neutral colours, natural light is your best friend to bring those colours to life and create a sense of movement by creating reflections and playing with the undertones of the paint. This is a good reason to pick the colours carefully - a simple white is not the same as white with grey undertones, and trust us, you want to nail that choice. This is precisely why we at Lick have our colour consultants ready to help you with any advice you might need. All it takes is a short call and you’ll be ready to roll.\n\n# 5. Wood is good\nWith a focus on craftsmanship, natural materials and simplicity, the philosophy behind the Scandinavian “hygge” remains relevant now more than ever. Wooden details go hand in hand with neutral colours - that’s why you should consider including them in your decoration strategy to get closer to the Scandinavian utopia. Exposed wooden floors and ceiling planks look beautiful when combined with white and grey, and they’ll also add a vintage touch to your space by complementing its original architecture. Wood is a natural material, so count on it to transform your rooms into Instagram-worthy artworks, bringing the outdoorsy spirit of the Scandinavians into your interior.\n\n# 6. Tidy up Marie Kondo style\nYou all know the rule here - if it doesn’t spark joy (or doesn’t add anything to the final aesthetic look), get rid of it. Scandinavians take pride in having incredibly clean, minimal, almost sterile rooms. That doesn’t mean that their homes are not cosy or homely, quite the opposite. By getting rid of the clutter, you’re able to clean your mind and focus on the things you actually need in your home. Sure, you can add throw pillows and a stack of magazines in the living room but stay away from extra furniture and details that might ruin the balance.\n\n# 7. Keep the lines clean\nClean lines - clean minds. Use well-defined objects and furniture in your decoration, focusing on squares and circles. To have the perfect Scandinavian home, make sure you also use a lot of geometry - from the kitchen details to the posters on the wall. Various shapes can define the space and be the perfect final touch you’re looking for to finish your interior project.\n\nAre you ready to transform your space?",
