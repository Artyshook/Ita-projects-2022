# Learn Javascript Fast by “Hacking” Your Favorite Websites

The best way to learn a new programming language is to learn by doing. 
Learn some useful JavaScript functions in less than 30 minutes by trying 
out these scripts on your favorite website(s). This walk through is good 
for beginners. No fancy setup, just you, the browser, and the terrifying
yet beautiful programming language that is JavaScript.

### STEP 0: Open the dev tools console.

If you are using.. 

Chrome:

*View → Developer → Developer Tools and then click the Console tab*

Firefox:

*Tools > Web Developer > Toggle Tools and the Console tab should 
already be open*

You will be copying and pasting the code below into the browser’s console and then hitting
the enter key. I encourage you to play around and modify the code as you go through
these 3 hacks. All these hacks are using vanilla JavaScript (aka no jQuery).

### 1. Learn to use JavaScript’s alert() function

* Sometimes used in debugging, alert() will pop up a small dialogue box in the browser. 
Go ahead and modify the code below to include your own message.
\(Don’t worry, you are the only one who will see this dialog box, you aren’t actually 
hacking the website!) ***See image:*** [link](https://i.imgur.com/He1mv08.png)

### 2. Use Math.random() to give everything different orientations

* By selecting the div, p, span, img, a, and body tag(s) and using Math.random() 
you can give everything on the page random orientations, producing a very entertaining effect!

### 3.Change all <"img"> tags to have cat pictures 

This script selects all the images on the page and adds a new src tag. Modify this script by
adding a link to your favorite photo (you can use the Cat API for all your cat picture needs).
